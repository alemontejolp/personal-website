# Personal Website

A website to introduce myself, show my public projects and my work experience.

Feel free to clone it and fill it with your information. ;)

This website was developed using Django (v4.2) as web framework, Bootstrap (v5.3) as frontend toolkit and Poetry (v1.5) as dependency manager.

* Run `python manage.py migrate` to setup the database.
* Run `python manage.py runserver` to start the development server.
